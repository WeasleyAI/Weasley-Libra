@rivindubandara If you want to set a global "preset" for everyone, use a modelSpec., where you can image and custom instructions

you can change logo of the endpoint by creating a custom endpoint. You can modify the logo by changing the logo.svg in client/public/assets. What you did with the css it's pretty good, it's more likely to be a cache issue, try disabling cache in the inspect network tab and also test the changes on a fresh browser

Hey, whenever I change the logo in client/public/assets, it never updates when deployed via docker. Does anyone know why?

Are you rebuilding the image or just using the deploy-compose.yml? If deploy with docker compose you should look into the docker-override docs here https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/docker_override

This will allow you to pass your own custom logos, etc. into the built image without having to rebuild it yourself.

version: '3.4'
 
services:
  api:
    volumes:
      - ./client/public/assets/logo.svg:/app/client/public/assets/logo.svg
      - etc....

I have this and no version, I will try yours

services:
api:
volumes:
- ./client/public/assets:/app/client/public/assets
- type: bind
source: ./librechat.yaml
target: /app/librechat.yaml

Here is my docker-compose.override.yml file contents:

version: '3.4'

services:
  api:
    volumes:
      - ./client/public/assets/favicon-16x16.png:/app/client/public/assets/favicon-16x16.png
      - ./client/public/assets/favicon-32x32.png:/app/client/public/assets/favicon-32x32.png
      - ./client/public/assets/favicon-16x16.png:/app/client/dist/assets/favicon-16x16.png
      - ./client/public/assets/favicon-32x32.png:/app/client/dist/assets/favicon-32x32.png
      - ./client/public/assets/logo.svg:/app/client/dist/assets/logo.svg
      - ./client/public/assets/custom_icon.png:/app/client/dist/assets/custom_icon.png
      - ./client/public/assets/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png:/app/client/public/assets/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png
      - ./client/public/assets/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png:/app/client/dist/assets/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png
      - ./client/public/assets/maskable-icon.png:/app/client/public/assets/maskable-icon.png
      - ./client/public/assets/maskable-icon.png:/app/client/dist/assets/maskable-icon.png
      - ./client/manifest.webmanifest:/app/client/dist/manifest.webmanifest
      - ./client/new_index.html:/app/client/dist/index.html
I can't remember which one worked to change the icon for the saved webapp thing, but I think it was something to do with the ./client/manifest.webmanifest or something
{"name":"CustomName Chat","short_name":"CustomName Chat","start_url":"/","display":"standalone","background_color":"#000000","lang":"en","scope":"/","theme_color":"#009688","icons":[{"src":"/assets/favicon-32x32.png","sizes":"32x32","type":"image/png"},{"src":"/assets/favicon-16x16.png","sizes":"16x16","type":"image/png"},{"src":"/assets/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png","sizes":"180x180","type":"image/png"},{"src":"/assets/maskable-icon.png","sizes":"512x512","type":"image/png","purpose":"maskable"}]}

I hope this helps @InvaderJ, sorry for not getting back sooner.

@joseph-holland No sorries allowed! This is hugely helpful, thank you so much. I managed to solve my PWA icon issue.

Of course the next hurdle, which is technically answered by your own manifest content, is the name of the PWA. I've changed it in vite.config.ts, no dice. I then made an override to try and force my own vote.config.ts in, no dice. And, I changed the title in index.html and have an override there as well.

My manifest.webmanifest always comes back with the original "LibreChat" name for the PWA.

Wondering if there was anything else you did to get the PWA title changed? I see you are forcing your own manifest.webmanifest. I'm still assuming Vite would generate properly against its own config file but that seems not to be the case. Hmm.

Thanks again!

I think I also had to create a custom index.html too and override the default. AFAIK when I was looking at this the ts file wouldn't be processed properly because we're not building it, don't quote me on that üòÅ.

The answer is definitely in the list above. Also I started from the first line down, so the index.html was the last file I modified, so I'm 99% sure that was it. I think it was as simple at the title attribute.

Make sure the modified manifest file is being put in the correct destination folder too. I think something like that tripped me up also.

Make sure to clear cache too or something. I think when I was originally hitting this, even if I removed the PWA icon from the homescreen when i added it back it kept the old name. I think I had to go into the site in the browser and remove any files from that site to fix this. It's been about six months since I hit these issues, so I can't fully remember.

this is what i am adding to docker override, ( i have even tried different settings as per above posts).
api:
volumes:
- ./librechat.yaml:/app/librechat.yaml
- ./assets/favicon-16x16.png:/app/assets/favicon-16x16.png
- ./assets/favicon-32x32.png:/app/assets/favicon-32x32.png

You need to use /app/client/dist/assets not /app/assets. Like so.

./logo.svg:/app/client/dist/assets/logo.svg

One tricky thing I found here too is that your browser can cache the old logo also. I found some strange behaviour like that when originally testing this. Try in a new private window, etc.

and your new logo.svg needs to be your base /LibreChat folder. You also did /root instead of /app. and then this should be part of the docker compose override file.

nothing works, and i believe this is due to remote server installation, as app is already built by danny and logo gets overwritten from compiled version every time.

here is from remote server installation page:

Note: this is using a special compose file optimized for this deployed environment. If you would like more configuration here, you should inspect the deploy-compose.yml and Dockerfile.multi files to see how they are setup. We are not building the image in this environment since it‚Äôs not enough RAM to properly do so. Instead, we pull the latest dev-api image of librechat, which is automatically built after each push to main.

I'm not sure. This is my docker compose override file and it works for me. I also start via sudo docker compose -f deploy-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml

services:
api:
volumes:
- type: bind
source: ./librechat.yaml
target: /app/librechat.yaml
- ./apple-touch-icon-180x180.png:/app/client/dist/assets/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png
- ./apple-touch-icon-180x180.png:/app/client/dist/assets/favicon-16x16.png
- ./apple-touch-icon-180x180.png:/app/client/dist/assets/favicon-32x32.png
- ./logo.svg:/app/client/dist/assets/logo.svg
- ./button-arrow.svg:/app/client/dist/assets/button-arrow.svg
- ./index.html:/app/client/dist/index.html
